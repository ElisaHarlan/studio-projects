# How German cities organize their aging population

----------------------------------------

### by Elisa Harlan

The Germans die out. This is one of the most repeated sentences in news articles about the demographical change of the German population. Researchers and politicians are complaining about it since years. But it is true. The aging structure in Germany is characterized by the fact that since 1972 the mortality rate is higher than the birth rate. This is not new, but due to the higher life expectancy of the population and at the same time a stagnating birth rate, the proportion of older people increases compared to younger people.

The influx of foreigners results in a small "rejuvenation effect" for the remaining population, but still a balance can not be reached. Therefore the care sector is steadily growing. This project wants to point out how big the increase in nursing homes and care services really is and whether it can serve the needs of the concerned group.

For this dataproject, I would to take a look at two claims that are publicly made since years, the first is:
"Germany suffers from a nursing crisis. There are less and less nurses that care for older people and the situation is getting worse".
Taking a look at the 16 capital cities of the "Bundesländer", the regions in Germany, we can see that in fact, the personell and the spots in nursery homes grow all-in-all steadily and in most cities in a parallel way.

When exmining the data, one has to keep in mind several restrictions:  Firstly, it is not displayed how the newly employed personell is qualified for the job. Secondly, it is a fact that if people get older, they suffer from several illnesses at the same time. This is more time intensive and might underline the impression of staff shortage.

The second thing that is constantly repeated, is that care must be organised differently in the future. It seems that the trend is downward, the concept of a nursery home is getting more and more unpopular. Families want to look after their elderly at home, but at the same time they don't want to give up their independece, their jobs to look after them. Since a couple of years it is getting more and more popular to have a nurse or a similarily trained person at home. The families who can afford it, pay between 2000 and 6000 Euros per month. The nurse is there for the old person 24 hours a day. Those persons are mostly women, coming from Eastern European countries.

The option that is somehow in between is nursery services, mainly providid by the Christian welfare and social work. These nurses come by everyday and help with serving food, bathing and giving injections. As we can see from the chart, in some cities, the nursery services are growing a lot, some cities seem to put emphasize on developing new nursery homes. 
This could be the starting point how cities handle their aging population.
