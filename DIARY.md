# studio-projects

1 project/1 week 
Cycling in Stuttgart
project failed, dataset was too small and did not really answer the questions I was having about the topic. Other data was not available because the three persons that I was contacting did not have/did not want to give me the necessary datasets.

1 project/1 week
Fat cats in Brooklyn
This project worked out really well, eventhough the questions about foodinspection etc. were not going really deep into the materia.
Learned how to convert addresses into geofiles with geocodio. Made a map with html and leaflet and read in the cat data.
